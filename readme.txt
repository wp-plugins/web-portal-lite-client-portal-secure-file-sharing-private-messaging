<p></p>
<p>Hi WP-Client!</p>
<p>I would like to tell you about how your plugin has transformed my Thai language school.</p>
<p>My wife and I have developed a complete solution to help learners of Thai language. We provide learners and teachers the materials they need to either learn or teach Thai.</p>
<p>We wanted our students and teachers to access and download stages of learning materials as they progress through their learning experience. WP-Client has given us the ability to provide a personal learning space where our clients can practice new language skills online and access everything they need to learn. WP-Client has given us the flexibly we needed to provide this solution in a very professional and simple way.</p>
<p>We have only been using WP-Client for about 2 months but we already have more than 150 clients using our online learning space. The plugin has saved us time, money and allows us to get a new student or teacher setup within minutes so they have instant access to their learning materials.</p>
<p>The system allows selected users access to our valuable materials where we can monitor usage with successful login emails and we know where clients login with their IP address.</p>
<p>WP-Client has transformed the way we work and is helping hundreds of people learn Thai language.</p>
<p>Thank you WP-Client!"</p>

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

<h3 style="margin-bottom:10px;">Flexibility & Power</h3>

Please understand that WP-Client is a very flexible & powerful tool. If you are having trouble understanding how to apply it to your application, our Support Team will be happy to help you get a clearer picture of how you can configure the plugin to accomplish your needs.

<strong><a href="https://wp-client.com/testimonials/">REVIEWS: Read the comments about our Support Team</a></strong>

One result of this extreme flexibility, is that it becomes difficult to provide "step 1-2-3" guides for the plugin, as these steps won't necessarily apply to all of our customers' needs. For every "case" we provide as an example, we will end up leaving out dozens of other scenarios that WP-Client would be perfect for. We hope that the development path we are taking will make the plugin even easier to use going forward.

</ul>
<h4 style="margin-bottom:10px;">Reason #5: No Risk 100% Money Back Guarantee</h4>

We consider our 100% Money Back Guarantee a valuable tool for gathering real world feedback from real world users. It doesn't happen often, but if WP-Client doesn't fit your needs, then you have nothing to worry about. See Details

<h3 style="margin-bottom:10px;">What is our 100% Money Back Guarantee?</h3>

We know that you'll be satisfied with WP-Client, but if for any reason, the product doesn't fit your needs, we are happy to provide a full refund for WP-Client if your request falls within 15 days of your initial purchase.

If you need additional time to evaluate the plugin, simply contact us to request an additional time window.

<h3>Why should you trust that we'll issue a refund?</h3>

Because we have NEVER kept a customer's money who has asked for it back within the evaluation period.

Each week, we have a wide range of customers who purchase the plugin assuming it will fit their needs. In a very few cases, for a variety of reasons, WP-Client ends up not being what the customer expected, or not exactly the best fit for accomplishing their goals. Typically, our Support Team can quickly guide the customer through any confusion, but there are cases where WP-Client might not be the perfect fit.

In more than a few of these cases, we find that customers ask for a refund thinking that WP-Client won't allow them to get a certain result, when in fact, the plugin can deliver that result. For this reason, if a customer requests a refund, we will politely ask for a brief explanation of why they feel the plugin won't work for them.  This lets us be sure that they aren't missing or misunderstanding a functionality that would serve their purposes, but it also helps us be in tune with the many variations our customers are trying to find solutions for. By asking the customer why they would like a refund, we are able to guide the direction of WP-Client's development based on the feedback from our interactions.

So, in the end, our Refund Policy is a good thing for us! Because we value the opinions of our customers so much, we see our refund policy as a valuable tool for gathering real world feedback from real world users.

For these reasons, you have no worries that we will try to keep your money.

<h3 style="margin-bottom:10px;">How do I request a refund?</h3>

Simply submit a support ticket requesting a refund
